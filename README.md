# raster2hdf
This repository is a collection of methods that, generally speaking, read different types of raster data and store the data in conjunction with the meta-information in hdf5-files. This project's goal is to organize an efficient workflow of processing geospatial data and condesing the different data formats with their particular methods of meta-data-handling to a single standardized format.
The authors aim to establish a growing open library of methods for transforming data from different sources to a common format (hdf5).
So far availabe:
